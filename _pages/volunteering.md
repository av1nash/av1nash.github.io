Volunteering for a non-profit organization is a great way to grow as a person, you get to meet so many awesome indivudals who bring change in other people lives and you get to be a part of that experience.

In the last three years I had the privilege of volunteering for a bunch of local (Charleston, SC) non-profit organizations and wanted to share some of my experiences here.

I built data products primarily on Azure platform. 
I have experience in:
* Orchestrating data pipelines to pull data from myriads of data sources (SAAS platforms, On-prem databases, files)
* Transforming data using python, sql & dbt
* Building semantic layer on a data warehouse for data consumption
* Applying DevOps practice to run all of the above in a highly scalable environment.

I love solving challenging problems in this space and it will be my pleasure to help you think through an architecture problem, big picture perspective on a data program or simply a bug you can't seem to find a solution for.

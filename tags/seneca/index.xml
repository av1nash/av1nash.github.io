This form of writing is called Epistles and is defined as
a poem or other literary work in the form of a letter or series of letters
Written by the Roman philosopher Seneca to Lucilius who was apparently a friend.
There are total 124 such letters and I just read and made some notes on the first one - On saving time.</description></item></channel></rss>

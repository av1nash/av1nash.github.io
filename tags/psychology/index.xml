Psychological reactance is &amp;ldquo;an unpleasant motivational arousal that emerges when people experience a threat to or loss of their free behaviors.&amp;rdquo; An example of such behavior can be observed when an individual engages in a prohibited activity in order to deliberately taunt the authority who prohibits it, regardless of the utility or disutility that the activity confers.
Streisand effect is an example of psychological reactance, wherein once people are aware that some information is being kept from them, they are significantly more motivated to access and spread that information.</description></item></channel></rss>

Examples: In Windows operating system, when you hit &amp;ldquo;F1&amp;rdquo; on keyboard it usually opens the help for that particular program, if you created a program which instead closed the window - it will astonish the users of your program and should be redesigned according to the principle of least astonishment.</description></item></channel></rss>
